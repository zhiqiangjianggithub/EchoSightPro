__EchoSight Pro__ is an ultrasound software engine, which I developed by myself for fun. Compared to exsiting ultrasound research platform for public use, such as Field II, Focus, KWAVE, MUST and ect, __EchoSight Pro__ is of  different goal. 

It is efficiency oriented, engineering based and product level architectured. It can used combining with those pure research platform for your study, acadamic research or prototype machine evaluation in real time.

To know the existing research platform check the link below
-Field II https://field-ii.dk/
-Focus    https://www.egr.msu.edu/~fultras-web/





If you are using for acadThe purpose is for fun and interest. It provides the core signal chain, including software beamforming, RTB, synthetic aperture, MLA and more than that its software design is highly engineering oriented.
