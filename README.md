# EchoSightPro
EchoSightPro is an ultrasound imaging software engine, which I developed by myself. The purpose is for fun and interest. It provides the core signal chain, including software beamforming, RTB, synthetic aperture, MLA and more than that its software design is highly engineering oriented.
