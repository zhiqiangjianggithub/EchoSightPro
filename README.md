## Overview ##
__EchoSight Pro__ is an ultrasound software engine, which I developed by myself for fun. Compared to exsiting ultrasound research platform for public usage, such as Field II, Focus, KWAVE, MUST and ect focusing on sound field simulation, __EchoSight Pro__ is of different goal. 

It is efficiency oriented, engineering based and product level architectured for handling raw ultrasound signal, no matter it is from simulation or real channel data. It can be used combining with those pure research platform for your study, acadamic research or advanced prototype machine evaluation in real time.

## Predecessor History ##
Previously, I have developed its predecessor EchoSight, which has done already, but not opened for public usage. EchoSight is support real time software beam forming, including IQ beam forming, Recursive Transmit Beamforming, Synthetic beamforming, Multiple Line Acqusition beam forming already, and can work on CPU only and CPU + GPU case both, support linear and phase probes, supporting steering for compounding, all of them can be in real time.

If you have any intesests on its predecessor, you check the link below for development log

__EchoSight Pro__ is the complete upgrade, rebuild version of its predecessor, actually I rewrote all the codes again
